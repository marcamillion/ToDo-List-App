## To Do List Maker ##

This app is just a basic app that allows you to create to-do lists.

I did this, as part of my Rails 3 learning process.

The trickiest part of this app, for me, was working through the nested routing of a list/:id/task/:id.

It's built on Rails 3.1.3, uses the 'best-in-place' gem for in place editing, and uses very basic styles from Twitter's Bootstrap - http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/.

A live version is hosted on Heroku and can be seen here:
